						<h1>Wheatstraw Tree Card</h1>
				
						<p>Christmas bells open to a fold-out holiday tree, beautifully crafted from hand-cut wheat straw. </p>
				
						<p>Artisans cut and flatten wheat straw and even it by scraping with a knife. For larger pieces, wheat straw strips are fixed to paper to form a sheet 
						from which designs are cut. For more detailed designs wheat straw is cut into thin strips, pieced together in layers. Artisans apply heat in varying 
						degrees to make the range of tones from tan to dark brown or black. The cardboard base is covered with cloth to complete the item.</p>

						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>

						<p>Rishilpi, a nonprofit, nongovernmental development organization in southwest Bangladesh, was founded to improve the lives of people of the Rishi caste.
						"Rishilp" is formed from two Bengali words, "Rishi," denoting the caste, and "shilpi," meaning artist or craftsman. Rishi, traditionally leather workers, 
						for centuries have lived at the margins of Bengali society. Generally landless, with no easy access to schools, many struggled in a continual search for work to 
						survive. By giving these artisans education and employment, Rishilpi helps them breach barriers confronting them in society. In addition to income generation, Rishilpi conducts relief and development work in rural Bangladesh communities. Benefits to artisans include education sponsorship, health care, microcredit 
						savings programs and early marriage prevention support for their adolescent daughters. </p>
				
						<p>Rishilpi was founded in 1977 by two Italian missionaries to improve the lives of the Rishi caste. More than 1,580 artisans make and market crafts through Rishilpi.
						Embroidery, wheat straw, palm leaf and jute sections provide work for poor women from rural villages who have been widowed or abandoned. Some women twist jute 
						into cord at home and others knot macram√© crafts at the center. Men at the Rishilpi leather center, many of them disabled, fashion wood and leather products.</p>
