						<h1>Water Lilies Batik Hanging</h1>
				
						<p>A batiked field of water lilies stretches into the distance. Artisans from south India create this cotton wall hanging using the wax-and-dye batik process, 
						an art believed to be at least 2,000 years old.</p> 
					
						<p>Using this technique, the artisan creates a design by permeating an area of fabric with hot wax so the wax resists the penetration of dye. This is done in 
						stages, with darker dye used in each successive stage. When the process is complete, the fabric is almost entirely waxed. Artisans place the fabric between 
						sheets of absorbent paper and apply a hot iron. As sheets of paper absorb the wax they are replaced by fresh sheets until all the wax is removed. At this point, the final design is visible for the first time.</p>
				
						<p>The International Foundation for Fairtrade and Development (IFFAD) based in Chennai, India, works to promote the economic and social well-being of marginalized people through the production and marketing of a wide range of handmade items. Some 56,000 artisans benefit from skill development, business training and product design through IFFAD. Eighty to 90 percent of the artisans are women, most of whom have limited schooling.</p>
