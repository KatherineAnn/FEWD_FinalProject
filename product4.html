						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>
					
						<p>Mai Vietnamese Handicrafts is a nonprofit organization that provides income generation and marketing services to Vietnamese artisans. Mai Handicrafts runs several craft production projects and markets the work of numerous other craft producers. During recent years, Mai Handicrafts has established 
						itself as the primary marketing agent for artisans from neglected families and women. It practices a model of social development in which social 
						service cannot be separated from economic self-reliance. Mai Handicrafts sales fund various community development activities, including clean water 
						projects, vocational training equipment purchase and teacher wage subsidies. Mai Handicrafts artisans receive social and health insurance, and can 
						apply for scholarship funds.</p>
					
						<p>Mai Vietnamese Handicrafts began in 1991 as a program for street children, started by social workers. The organization originally worked with children 
						who could not go to school due to lack of legal papers and inability to pay tuition. Mai Handicrafts gave them work and provided informal literacy 
						classes. Now that schooling is free for all children in Vietnam, Mai Handicrafts has expanded their mandate to provide work for the poor and marginalized, including women and ethnic minority groups.</p>
