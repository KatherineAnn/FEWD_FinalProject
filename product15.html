						<h1>Lidded Kaisa Basket</h1>
				
						<p>Wide kaisa storage basket features a fitted lid with knob. Hand-woven in Bogra, Bangladesh, by women artisans of Dhaka Handicrafts. </p>
				
						<p>Kaisa is a sturdy wild grass that dries from its natural light green to a pale, almost tan color.Artisans cut kaisa grass from riverbanks during the monsoon season, leaving the roots for the next yearâ€™s crop. Later growth of kaisa is thicker and stronger, and is used to make fences in the villages. The cut kaisa grass is sundried and cleaned, then woven into baskets.</p>
