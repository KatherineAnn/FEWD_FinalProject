						<h1>Kenyan Wildlife Chess Set</h1>
				
						<p>A uniquely beautiful gift for that important chess player in your life. This special item features inlaid black and white kisii stone with hand-carved playing pieces. 
						The safari chess pieces roaming the board are lions, lionesses, elephants, rhinos, zebras, and antelopes. Elephants and antelopes decorate the borders of the board. Kisii soapstone, found only in Kenya, is a soft stone, easy to carve into many forms. Its satiny finish is achieved through multiple stages of sanding, followed by waxing. In some cases, as with this piece, 
						artisans also apply color.</p>

						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>

						<p>Kisac Fair Trade Ltd. is an artisan-based group made up of members, employees and artisans. The group's goals include the following: 
						1) improve the standard of living of members and participating artisans through the production and sale of soapstone carvings; 
						2) improve the social, economic and environmental well being of marginalized communities in the local area through active 
						participation in community-based projects; 3) operate an equitable business that involves the sharing of profits between members, 
						employees and artisans; and 4) promote fair trade and social justice within the community.</p>
					
						<p>The group was formed in 1998 as Kisii Soapstone Art and Craft (KISAC), and formally registered as a self-help group on March 17, 2003 
						under Kenya's Ministry of Culture and Social Services. It was later incorporated as a limited company under the new name Kisac Fair Trade Ltd. (KFT) in November 2008. Throughout its existence, Kisac has generated income for its members, artisans and employees. Kisac has also provided support to orphans and widows, and has spearheaded a community water project in Kisii, currently serving more than 1,200 households.</p>
