						<p>Green tea, black tea or herbal tea, you’ll love it served from this sleek little teapot. </p>
					
						<p>To make these ceramics, artisans form clay in a mold, hand-finish it and apply a crackle glaze to create pieces with contemporary style and old-world technique. This unique appearance is achieved by grinding glass into powder and combining it with oxide before applying to the bowl. After this the bowl is dipped into the glaze and fired slowly, yielding the beautiful crackle finish.</p>

						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>
					
						<p>Craft Link, a nonprofit organization, works with Vietnamese artisans to generate income, with a focus on ethnic minorities, street children and 
						artisans with disabilities. Craft Link also markets products from traditional Vietnamese handicraft villages. Craft Link helps artisan groups 
						design new products and develop marketing opportunities.They often send a team of designers and project officers to live in a village to work on new ideas, provide training for artisans in management, 
						bookkeeping, costing, pricing and product development. Craft Link sells artisans’ handicrafts locally, and exports their handicrafts to fair trade 
						organizations and commercial companies around the world.The organization’s goals include cultural preservation, public education on traditional handicraft, income generation for small-scale Vietnamese 
						artisans and acquiring new markets. Artisans working with Craft Link receive tools, interest-free loans, education, training and literacy classes.</p>
					
						<p>Craft Link was established in 1996 by a group of international nongovernmental organizations, including Mennonite Central Committee, Oxfam and the 
						Ford Foundation. It was founded to help generate income for poor and marginalized people, and to help traditional handicraft groups find markets 
						within Vietnam’s changing economic system. Craft Link is a member of the International Fair Trade Association (IFAT).</p>
