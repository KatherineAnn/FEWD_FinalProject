						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>

						<p>In 1995 Claytone Ombasyi, a Christian businessman in Nairobi, Kenya, started OTIC, a privately held export and marketing company. Ombasyi, with 
						professional experience in exporting and marketing, wanted to help local artisans connect with export markets. He operates his business with the 
						utmost integrity and expects the same of others, encouraging artisans to consider their products a reflection of themselves and to use the products 
						to share their vision with customers. OTIC provides export, packaging and quality control support for a number of small workshops in and around Nairobi. 
						Depending on their circumstances, these small groups provide a variety of advantages to their artisans. Some offer training in wood carving, while others 
						provide shortâ€“term, no interest loans.</p>
