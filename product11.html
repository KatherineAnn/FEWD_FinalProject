						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>
					
						<p>Proexport is a marketing organization helping small Nicaraguan handicraft producers market their products internationally. Proexport follows fair trade principles and helps artisans with better production techniques.</p>
					
						<p>Proexport was founded in 2002. A previous microtrade project called Proarte existed from 1990 to 2002, helping small producers survive as 
						Nicaragua’s economic policy changed and many businesses went bankrupt with the loss of protected markets. At the disbanding of Proarte, its 
						general manager, Francisco Pineda, elected to continue his work with Nicaraguan artisans. With new focus and vision, Proexport works with the same artisans.</p>
