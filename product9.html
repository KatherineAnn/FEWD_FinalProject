						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>
					
						<p>Dominion Traders works with underprivileged artisans who make stone and shesham wood crafts in the city of Karachi. It disperses orders to 
						independently owned and operated onyx workshops that own their own equipment and rent or own their facilities. Most are family businesses employing several family members. These workshops are scattered throughout Pakistan, and employ artisans of different religions and creeds who work together in cordial relationships. Benefits to artisans include profit-sharing, pension plans and medical benefits. Dominion Traders provides interest-free loans and advances to artisans. </p>
					
						<p>The late Mansoor Ali founded Dominion Traders, using business management skills he learned from his father. Mansoor Ali was also the pioneer in 
						introducing fair trade practices in the stone industry in Pakistan. Unusually for Pakistan, he chose to hire artisans regardless of religion or 
						ethnicity. No Syed Fahad Ali, son of Mansoor Ali, is following his fatherâ€™s footsteps in managing Dominion Traders. </p>
