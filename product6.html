						<h1>Laurel Leaf Frame</h1>
				
						<p>Vining laurel leaves make a natural setting for your 5x7 photo. Handcrafted in smoked capiz clam shell. </p>
					
						<p>Capiz is the thin, off-white shell of the windowpane oyster. Artisans wash the shells with soap and water, then soak them in a weak acid solution. 
						After the shells have dried, they are cut into shapes, edged with brass wire that is soldered together. The piece is then smoked to achieve the lovely 
						burnished appearance. A wire edge and a shiny coat of varnish complete this labor intensive process.</p>

						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>

						<p>Saffy stands for Social Action for Filipino Youth. Saffy Handicrafts is the business export arm of SAFRUDI, the Social Action Foundation for Rural and 
						Urban Development, a social services organization. (SAFRUDI markets crafts domestically through its ManoMano fair trade store.) SAFRUDI markets products 
						for many small artisan workshops, and runs its own production unit specializing in capiz shell items. Artisans benefit from educational seminars, vocational 
						training, financial and medical assistance. An in-house Product Designer assists artisan groups in the development of new product lines.</p>
					
						<p>Saffy was founded in 1966 by Sr. Juliaan Mullie, a Belgian nun, to create alternative sources of livelihood for impoverished women and youth in marginalized areas of Manila. It expanded to serve communities in need by launching social development programs. The organization legally incorporated in 1970 as SAFRUDI, retaining Saffy as its trade name for export items. SAFRUDI is a member of the International Fair Trade Association (IFAT), and is affiliated with Advocate of Philippine Fair Trade, Inc., Asia Fair Trade Forum and Philippine Fair Trade Forum.</p>
