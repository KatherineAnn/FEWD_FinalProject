						<h1>Lavender Leaves Earrings</h1>
					
						<p>Organically shaped tagua nut slices, dyed a gentle lavender, with laser-etched spirals. Produced by the Bogota-based workshop of Lizzie Zuniga. This tagua comes from the region surrounding the Colombian port city of Tumaco, on the Pacific Ocean near the Ecuador border.</p>
				
						<p>Also known as “vegetable ivory,” 
						tagua is produced by a palm-like tree. The nuts fall to the ground when mature, thus harvesting does not damage the trees. Tagua nut’s grain is close and very hard, resembling the finest ivory. Artisans carve each nut individually into the desired form. Cultural tradition and forest preservation combine in the use of this renewable resource.</p>

						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>
					
						<p>Sapia, formerly Piel Acida, was originally conceived in 1995 by Ana Piedrahita, an entrepreneur in Colombia's capital city of Bogota. 
						Piedrahita had seen a box from Uruguay that was produced from dried orange peel, and recognized the potential for producing a wide array 
						of unique and intriguing items from this material. She decided to pursue a business specializing in the design and production of the products. 
						As the business grew, Piedrahita brought in business partner Javier Cardenas to provide additional professional management skills and to help in 
						expanding the market for their products. The organization was formally registered in 2000.</p>
				
						<p>Sapia employs 32 artisans directly, with another 50-plus artisans working independently. They also support an additional group of people through 
						their purchase of orange peels, the raw material for their products. Colombia is among the highest per capita in orange juice consumption, which 
						has spawned a strong demand for fresh-squeezed juice. These vendors would normally have to pay to discard the used peels, but now can actually 
						earn additional income from selling them to Sapia.</p>
				
						<p>Sapia has incorporated fair trade principles in their operation, as they seek to develop the artisan-based handicraft sector in Colombia. While 
						Colombia has recently achieved a relatively good macroeconomic climate, people in the lower income brackets continue to face serious challenges. 
						Colombia ranks low in income equality, and also possesses one of the highest number of internally displaced persons of any country in the world. 
						They have used their sales growth as an opportunity to reach out to other artisan groups in rural areas of the country, and have worked diligently 
						to move beyond their original orange peel products and create new lines based on tagua, corn husk, cotton thread and recycled materials.</p>
				
						<p>In 2010, the organization changed its name from Piel Acida Cascaras de Naranja to Sapia. The name change reflects the depth and variety of products 
						it offers, and a merger with Salvarte, a Bogota-based retail operation. The new name combines portions of the names of the two formerly separate organizations.</p>
