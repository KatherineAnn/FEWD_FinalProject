						<h1>White Lilies Vase</h1>
				
						<p>Lovely white lilies and green stems hold your own bouquet, or make a lovely art piece of their own on table or shelf. Water-resistant varnish on interior. </p>
				
						<p>Experienced potters working in the Nicaraguan village of San Juan de Oriente use mineral oxides to provide color to this vase’s beautiful floral design, created using handmade tools to inscribe the surface of the clay. The vase is fired in low temperature kilns, then burnished with stone to create the warm, polished surface.</p>

						<h3>Artisan Story</h3>
					
						<p>Proexport is a marketing organization helping small Nicaraguan handicraft producers market their products internationally. Proexport follows fair trade principles and helps artisans with better production techniques.</p>
				
						<p>Proexport was founded in 2002. A previous microtrade project called Proarte existed from 1990 to 2002, helping small producers survive as Nicaragua’s economic policy changed and many businesses went bankrupt with the loss of protected markets. At the disbanding of Proarte, its general manager, Francisco Pineda, elected to continue his work with Nicaraguan artisans. With new focus and vision, Proexport works with the same artisans.</p>
